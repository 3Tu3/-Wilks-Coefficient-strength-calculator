# -Wilks-Coefficient-strength-calculator
Wilks coefficient is a measure used in powerlifting to compare the strength of lifters in different weight classes. It is named after Robert Wilks, who created the formula in 1994. The formula takes into account the lifter's body weight, as well as the weight lifted in the squat, bench press, and deadlift.

The level sistem is a sort of abstract way of mesuring strength witch was created using already existing ones like for example strengthlevel.com witch has something simillar to what i created tho it only has 5 instead of 10 levels

Another thing about the wilks coefficient is that the Wilks coefficient is used to determine the "relative strength" of a lifter, which is the amount of weight lifted relative to the lifter's body weight. A higher Wilks coefficient indicates a stronger lifter, regardless of their weight class it is also used in meny powerlifting competitions.
